What is PTV xServer .NET?
-------------------------

PTV xServer .NET is a supplement to the PTV xServer providing an abstraction 
and convenience layer for integrating PTV xServer into applications based on 
the Microsoft .NET Framework. 


Important Notes
---------------

For license details, please refer to the file LICENSE.TXT, which should have 
been provided with this distribution.

If you intend to install PTV xServer .NET into a path which requires administrative
rights, you have to execute the setup with elevated permissions.


Prerequisites
-------------

- At least Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 is recommended.

- At least Microsoft .NET 4.5.1 for running the demos provided through our 
  Demo Center.

- At least Visual Studio C# 2008 Express Edition for developing applications
  based on PTV xServer .NET. With regards to the WPF integration and the 
  overall development experience we recommend at least Visual Studio 2010.

- The demos provided require internet access as they make use of PTV xServer 
  running on a PTV test system. Usually you'll set up your own servers when 
  developing applications based on PTV xServer / PTV xServer .NET.

- All third-party libraries used by the SDK and the Demo Center are included 
  in the SDK package.


First Steps
-----------

- For a first glance start our Demo Center that is provided in compiled form.
  The Demo Center requires at least Microsoft .NET 3.5 and internet access to
  run properly.

- For developing applications using PTV xServer .NET, the source code of the
  Demo Center, provided in the folder .\source, along with our use case 
  documentation may be a good source of information.

- For details on PTV xServer, please refer to the PTV xServer documentation. 


Visual Studio Toolbox
---------------------

- Toolbox registration has to be done for every user separately.

- Toolbox registration is done by the setup of PTV xServer .NET for Microsoft
  Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2015 installations. Due to limitations of the
  Microsoft Visual Studio Express editions the PTV xServer .NET Toolbox Installer 
  is not capable of adding toolbox items in this case. 
  You can add the toolbox items manually as follows:
    * Open Microsoft Visual Studio Express
    * If desired create a new tab
    * Drag&Drop the 'Ptv.XServer.Controls.Map.dll' located in '<INSTALL_PATH>/lib'
     into the desired tab.
  To remove the toolbox items just delete the corresponding entries in the toolbox list.

- If for any reason Toolbox registration must be updated or renewed, please use
  our registration utility provided in the folder .\tools.


Release Notes 
-------------

Version 1.5.0.0 (2016/04/18)

  Bugfixes:

  - xMap ObjectInfos were still displayed after layer was disabled.
  - Incorrect Rendering for MapPolygon when InifiteZoom was activated.
  - MapRengtagle.GetEnvelope didn't consider the spatialReferenceId.
  - MapRectange.Equals() threw exception when rectangle was null.
  - XMapMetaInfo(baseUrl) didn't invoke the base constructor.


  Changes and Optimizations:

  - ConnectionLimit for ServicePointManager now isn't changed inside control classes.
  - Added china and world-map support for CompleteUrl().
  - Optimized tile loading and pruning.
  - Toolbox installer now also supports Visual Studio 2015.
  - Signing algorithm for SDK-Setup and DemoCenter.exe is now SHA256.


  DemoCenter Updates: 

  - Setting default map to World map.
  - Updated FeatureLayer samples for DemoCenter to match the current situation.
  - Added Gravelpit to profile selection.
  - Added link-button to the xServer.NET forum.
  - "Reset Use cases" button resets the DataManager and FeatureLayer use case too.
  - Fix map&market .mdb-Path for ClickOnce demo.
  - Fix swapped latitude/longitude in TourPlanning demo.
  - Cleaned up TourPlanning demo code.
  - FeatureLayer is only inserted at sample use case.



Version 1.4.0.0 (2015/07/30)

  Controls:
  - New interface IToolTips, which can be implemented by layers, to provide textual
    information around a dedicated location (commonly the mouse position).
    The UntiledLayer class implements this interface.
  
  - The layer responsible for showing content of Web Map Services is integrated into
    the Ptv.XServer.Controls.Map.dll. It allows re-projections of returned images to 
    achieve a matching of the content provided by accompanying layers.

  New Demo Center use cases, which are also available by the click-once-demo 
  from http://xserverinternet.azurewebsites.net/xserver.net/:
  - Feature Layer: By means of this tool, street attributes can be activated for
    route calculation and shown in the map. Five different types are integrated
    by this use case, eventually restricted by the availability in the used map:
    - Traffic incidents
    - Truck attributes
    - Preferred routes
    - Restriction zones
    - Speed patterns
  
  Demo Center:
  - A short user introduction is shown at start-up time.
  
  - The user can open and manipulate multiple use cases concurrently, which may result
    in a confusing GUI. By means of a new reset button, all these use cases can be 
    converted into its initial state.

  

Version 1.3.0.0 (2014/11/21)

  Controls:
  
  - The Map Controls are ready for access of PTV xServer internet, i.e. PTV xServer 
    functionality is available via Cloud.
	
  - New property XMapStyle in interface IMap added. It determines the coloring 
    of the background layer containing the town, street and areas like seas, 
    forests, industrial areas and so on. Internally, the provided style name is 
    textually extended to meet the requirements of the xServer configuration.
	
  - A new layer is implemented which shows the Here Satellite View. It is an 
    alternative to the still available, but no longer integrated Bing aerials 
    in DemoCenter.
	
  - At some certain zoom levels, the map images appeared blurred in former 
    versions; this bug is fixed.
	
  - The gadgets integrated in the Map Control (for example the layers gadget 
    or the zoom slider) do no longer raise any exception, when they are integrated 
    in a docking container, which may cause some re-initialization of these gadgets. 
    A proper releasing of all previously needed objects before re-initialization 
    prevents the exceptional situation.

  Visual Studio integration:
  
  - For WinForms and WPF different Map Controls are provided. In former versions, 
    only the WinForms map is integrated into the toolbox of Visual Studio. In the 
    new version, also the WPF Map is integrated.
	
  New Demo Center use cases, which are also available by the click-once-demo 
  from http://xserverinternet.azurewebsites.net/xserver.net/:

  - XServer connection: At run-time a server URL and an optional token can be 
    specified to demonstrate how different PTV xServers are addressed to achieve 
    their functionality – especially the PTV xServer internet, which is provided via 
    Azure currently. Because the latter needs a token, a time-limited one is provided 
    for testing. The source code of the Demo Center enforces a programmer to specify 
    the current test token or, if available, the purchased version.
	
  - To select geographical objects for further operations, a client-side selection 
    mechanism is shown in the same-named use case.
	
  - The Tour Planning use case demonstrates via randomly generated tour points, 
    depots and orders, how to access the xTour functionality in an asynchronous way. 
    A progress bar and status quo texts are shown without blocking the user interface.
	
  - By positioning the way points of a route via drag & drop, the corresponding 
    source code outlines the necessary steps.
	
  - The Shape Layer in the use case ‘Different Shapes’ is extended by pie-chart 
    objects and each object can be underlined by textual labels.
	
  - The layer containing the Bing Aerials is still available, but in the Demo Center 
    this layer is replaced by the Here Satellite View layer.
	
  - The previously available use cases Marker and Tours and Stops are removed because 
    their functionality is part of the new use cases mentioned above.
  
  
Version 1.2.0.0 (2013/06/12)

  Breaking Changes

  - Map: IUntiledProvider.GetImageStream has been modified to support double 
    precision coordinates. 

    Unless a custom provider has been implemented in your application, this 
    change is of minor importance. Where a custom provider has been implemented,
    integer type casts may get you to the previous behaviour. This change was 
    made in order to provide extended 'deep zoom support' through the label 
    layer.

  - Projections: OGC_GEODECIMAL has been renamed to OG_GEODECIMAL to conform 
    with the PTV xServer naming. OGC_GEODECIMAL has been kept as an alias in the 
    Registry; however, Ptv.Components.Projections.CoordinateReferenceSystem.XServer 
    no longer defines OGC_GEODECIMAL as an attribute. In addition, some managed 
    transformations have been refactored. These refactoring remain imperceptible 
    if the transformations are properly accessed via CoordinateTransformation.Get.

  - XMap layers: Interface of class XMapLayerFactory has been refactored 
    concerning all variants of InsertXMapBaseLayers. Instead of specifying different 
    combinations of XMapServer settings in varying parameters, these settings are 
    concentrated in a new class XMapMetaInfo. An instance of this class is used to 
    specify the XMapServer settings, which can be reused in calls to methods 
    XMapLayerFactory.InsertRoadEditor and XMapLayerFactory.InsertPOI.

  Others

  - Introduced a utility class for calculating the distance between two points
  - Optimized performance for xSaaS access (or xServer https access, respectively)
  - Changed Shape Layer to simplify implementation of custom shape types
  - Enhanced TiledLayer-API for implementation of custom providers
  - Provided the ability to incorporate arbitrary xMap Server layers into the map. 
    A conceptual page in PTV xServer .NET's help file provides additional documentation.
  - Added three new samples demonstrating drag&drop routing, tooltip display for xMap
    Server content and different rendering approaches (tiled, non-tiled bitmap, vector)
  - Fixed a panning problem that occurred on lower zoom levels 
  - Fixed layer ordering issue when using ILayer.Priority
  - Complemented the interoperability "How Tos" with a C++/MFC sample
  - Added a new property 'LazyUpdate' to the Shape Layer to improve performance for
    a large number of complex shapes

	
Version 1.1.0.0 (2013/03/11)

  Breaking Changes

  - <none>
   
  Others

  - Added support for zoom levels up to level 23.
  - Improvements for Shape Layer API.
  - Added INotifyPropertyChanged for ILayer and INotifyCollectionChanged for LayersCollection.
  - Added support for xSaaS.
  - Added sample for ActiveX-Integration.
  - Some minor fixes for rendering glitches.


Version 1.0.0.0 (2012/12/18)

   First Release   


Known Issues of Current Release
-------------------------------

- Visual Studio versions have to be installed completely and have to be started
  once before running the PTV xServer .NET setup. Otherwise the toolbox installer
  which is integrated in the PTV xServer .Net setup will not work properly.

- The provided Demo Center solution can only be opened with Visual Studio 2010 or
  higher. All components can nevertheless be used together with Visual Studio 2008.
  Using Visual Studio 2008, you can open the csproj file.

- Printing the code samples of the documentation via the provided link currently
  does not work.

- Changing the visibility of a map gadget at runtime has no effect on the map display.
  Currently, you can only change these settings at design time.

- Using the shape layer for a large number of dynamic objects (or complex objects) may 
  cause delays in the map's responsiveness. Unfortunately there is a limitation in 
  .NET's WPF layer that cannot be fixed to number. If you experience performance problems
  when using the shape layer we recommend to build an own rendering layer. Please refer
  to the documentation for additional information.
